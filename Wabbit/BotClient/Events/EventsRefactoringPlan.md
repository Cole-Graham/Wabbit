# Wabbit Tournament Bot - Refactoring Plan

## Project Overview

This document tracks our refactoring progress across three main focus areas:

1. **Events System Refactoring** - Breaking down monolithic event handlers into specialized components
2. **Match Status Management** - Implementing a centralized match status display system
3. **Thread Management** - Improving how threads guide players through tournaments
4. **Data Persistence and State Management** - Ensuring proper integration with state and repository services
5. **Service Integration** - Coordinating specialized tournament services with the new architecture

## 1. Events System Refactoring

### Current Issues with Event_Button.cs

1. **Excessive Size**: At over 2400 lines, the file is too large to easily understand and navigate.
2. **Mixed Responsibilities**: The class handles many different concerns (tournament signups, deck submissions, game results, map bans).
3. **Code Duplication**: Similar patterns are repeated across different handlers.
4. **Complex State Management**: The class directly manipulates complex nested state structures.
5. **Error-Prone**: The large, complex structure makes errors more likely when making changes.
6. **Hard to Test**: The monolithic design makes unit testing difficult.
7. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Signup embeds are formatted differently depending on how they are generated.
8. **Message Visibility Issues**: Some messages that should be ephemeral are persistent and vice versa.

- [x] Update any documentation that references Event_Button.cs

#### Phase 3: Other Event Types

After evaluating the needs of the application, we've decided to defer the implementation of additional event handlers:

- The component interaction handlers have been successfully implemented
- Message handling for deck submissions has been replaced with slash commands
- Reaction, Guild, and Voice event handlers weren't used in the original implementation
- Modern Discord bot patterns favor interactions over message/reaction handling

If these handlers are needed in the future, we can follow the same factory pattern established with component handlers.

#### Future Work Considerations

- **Event_Modal.cs Refactoring**: While Event_Modal.cs continues to function well in its current monolithic form, it could potentially be refactored using a similar pattern to ComponentInteractionHandler if its complexity increases:
  - Create a `ModalHandlerBase` abstract class
  - Implement a `ModalHandlerFactory` to route modal submissions to specialized handlers
  - Create specialized handlers for different types of modals (tournament creation, match setup, etc.)
  - This would improve maintainability and testability but isn't immediately necessary

## Modal Interaction Refactoring Implementation Plan

Based on the successful refactoring of component interactions, we'll now implement a similar pattern for modal interactions:

### 1. Base Architecture Setup

- [x] Implement `ModalHandlerBase` abstract class with common response methods
- [x] Create `ModalHandlerFactory` class for routing modal interactions
- [x] Create `ModalInteractionHandler` as the main entry point (relocated to MainHandlers directory)

  - [x] Add status notification when threads are being archived

## 4. Data Persistence and State Management

### Current Architecture
- The `TournamentStateService` manages in-memory state of tournaments and ongoing matches
- The `TournamentRepositoryService` handles persistence of tournament data to storage
- These services are referenced throughout the original `Event_Button.cs` file
- The new `TournamentMatchService` interacts with both services

### Integration Requirements
- [x] Ensure all component handlers have access to TournamentStateService
  - [x] Add as dependency in constructor for all relevant handlers
  - [x] Update DI registration to provide the service to handlers
- [x] Maintain consistent state persistence patterns across handlers
  - [x] Ensure state is saved after all user interactions that modify tournament data
  - [x] Use consistent patterns for loading and saving state
- [x] Audit data flow between refactored components and services
  - [x] Map all state service methods used in component handlers
  - [x] Verify all state updates are properly migrated to new handlers
  - [x] Identify any unused or redundant state service methods
- [x] Review transaction management
  - [x] Identify operations that update multiple data sources
  - [x] Ensure proper error handling and rollback for failed operations
  - [x] Maintain data consistency across services

### Data Flow Audit Findings

1. **State Service Usage Patterns**:
   - All component handlers consistently use `SaveTournamentStateAsync` to persist state changes
   - Most calls pass the Discord client correctly to allow for channel updates
   - State is saved after critical operations in each handler (deck submissions, map bans, etc.)
   - Modal handlers (`DeckSubmissionModalHandler`, `MapBanModalHandler`) properly save state changes
   - Component handlers (`DeckSubmissionHandler`, `MapBanHandler`) save state after confirmation buttons

2. **Multiple Data Source Operations**:
   - TournamentManagerService updates both state service and repository service during important operations
   - TournamentGameService properly updates both in-memory state and persistent storage
   - Tournament-related commands save state appropriately after modifications

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Implemented `SafeSaveTournamentStateAsync` in the TournamentStateService to provide:
     - Automatic retry logic (up to 3 attempts) for failed state saving operations
     - Detailed logging with caller context to trace state saving failures
     - Proper error handling and recovery for transient failures
     - Boolean return value to indicate save success/failure to callers
   - Updated DeckSubmissionHandler to use the new safe save method as a reference implementation
   - Added proper error handling around repository service calls in component handlers
   - Each handler should migrate to the new `SafeSaveTournamentStateAsync` method for better reliability

4. **Transaction Management**:
   - Identified operations that modify both in-memory state and repository data
   - Improved error handling with try-catch blocks around data persistence operations
   - Added logging to report persistence failures without crashing the application
   - Ensured operations that affect multiple data sources handle failures gracefully

### Future Work

The completed refactoring provides a solid foundation for future enhancements. Additional event handlers or modal refactoring can be implemented as needed, following the established patterns.

The refactoring has significantly improved the maintainability, testability, and readability of the codebase, making it easier to extend and adapt to changing requirements.
